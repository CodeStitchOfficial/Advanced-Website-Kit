# STARTER STYLES

#### CS-TODO

If you have merged a SASS/LESS branch into the kit, and want to use the styles from the unmodified kit in your preferred preprocessor, drag and drop the appropriate folder from ./starter-styles into ./src/assets. You're then free to delete the other folder.

If you want to start from a blank slate, you can delete ./starter-styles altogether.
